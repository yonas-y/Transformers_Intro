# ðŸ§  Transformer Basics â€“ Implementations

Welcome to this repository containing basic implementations of transformer architectures from scratch. This project is designed as a hands-on learning resource to understand how transformers work, particularly in the context of natural language processing (NLP).

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Transformers are the foundation of modern NLP models such as BERT, GPT, and T5. This repository walks through core components like self-attention, positional encoding, and multi-head attention, culminating in a minimal transformer architecture.
